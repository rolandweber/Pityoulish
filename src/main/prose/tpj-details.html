<p>
List the contents of the JAR file.
Use the <code title="jar -tf">jar</code> utility of a JDK,
or <code title="unzip -l">unzip</code>,
or any other archive utility that is compatible with the zip format.
The example output below shows only a subset of the files.
</p>

<p>
There are files of different types in the archive:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code></dt>
<dd>
  The manifest.
  The presence of this file tells the JVM that the archive is actually a JAR.
  In an executable JAR, one entry in the manifest specifies the main class,
  the entry point for the program.
  <br/>
  The <code>META-INF/</code> directory can also be used to store
  non-standard meta information about the JAR, for example a build timestamp.
</dd>
<dt><code>.../*.class</code></dt>
<dd>
  Compiled Java classes.
  The directories correspond to the package structure.
</dd>
<dt><code>.../*.java</code></dt>
<dd>
  Java source code.
  JAR files do not have to contain source code, but those for the exercises do.
  After all, it will be your task to fix bugs in the source code.
</dd>
<dt><code>.../package.html</code></dt>
<dd>
  JavaDoc package descriptions.
  The presence of these files suggest that there might be useful JavaDocs.
  It is always possible to generate JavaDocs from source code.
  But if the source code doesn't contain special JavaDoc comments,
  the generated docs are not necessarily useful. Alas, the mere presence of
  JavaDoc comments also doesn't ensure that they contain anything useful.
  Fortunately, this is a tutorial with well-documented source code.
</dd>
<dt><code>...CatalogData*.properties</code></dt>
<dd>
  Output strings for different languages.
  At runtime, the program uses the default locale of the JVM
  to decide which language to display.
<!--
  Strings for translating the program output into different languages.
  Properties files are used at runtime to look up strings or other values,
  by predefined lookup keys.
  A program that is enabled for translation does not contain output strings,
  but lookup keys instead. The output strings are stored in properties files.
  These properties files can be translated into different languages,
  which are stored in properties files with a similar name that includes
  a language identifier, for example </code>_de</code>.

<p>
Programs or libraries can also add other resources to a JAR,
for example images, HTML templates, and style sheets needed at runtime.

<h2 id="jar-trouble"><span>Troubleshooting your JAR</span></h2>

<p>
This section explains some problems you might run into
when building your own JAR.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>JAR is not executable</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The JAR file contains Java classes, properties files, and a manifest.
The JAR is executable when its manifest specifies an entry point,
which is a classname.
If you are using an IDE, configure class <code>pityoulish.tutorial.Main</code>
as the entry point in the manifest.
If you are using a command line, the entry point is specified
with option '<code>e</code>' of the <code>jar</code> command.
</p>
<p>
When you create a project from a JAR file, your IDE should
read the entry point from the manifest.
But if you create a project from source code in the file system,
your IDE generates a new manifest without an entry point.
</p>
<p>
Instead of creating an executable JAR, you can also specify the classname
when starting the program.
The JAR then has to be put on the classpath with <code>-cp</code>
rather than being executed with <code>-jar</code>:
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"
       ><span>java -cp tutorial.jar pityoulish.tutorial.Main</span></div>
</div>
</dd>

<dt>Output contains <code>CatalogData</code> instead of expected text</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Human-readable text for output is stored in properties files.
These properties files can be translated into different languages
without changing the source code and compiling new classes.
The properties files are part of the source code and
must be available at runtime.
If they are missing, the program will print lookup keys
instead of the texts it cannot look up.
</p>
<p>
If you are running a JAR file, bundle the properties files into the JAR.
<br/>
If you are running the program directly from an IDE project,
add the source directory to the classpath.
</p>
</dd>

<h2 id="encoding-trouble"><span>Troubleshooting Character Encodings</span>
<a href="#encoding-trouble" class="here-link">&para;</a></h2>

<p>
Internally, Java stores strings as
<a href="https://unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html">Unicode</a>
with 16 bit per character
(<a href="http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html">UTF-16</a>).
When writing strings as output, or reading strings as input,
they often have to be converted to or from other character encodings,
such as US-ASCII, Latin-15, or UTF-8.
Some of these can only represent a subset of the Unicode characters.
The last example simply uses a different representation for the characters.
</p>

<p>
A terminal or other software for displaying strings expects those in a
particular encoding. It uses a font with graphic representations of some
or all Unicode characters to render the string. If output appears garbled,
there are a plenty of things that might have gone wrong:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  The font does not have a graphic representation for the character.
  Sometimes, a square box is displayed as a replacement.
</li>
<li>
  The output encoding does not have a representation for the character.
  Sometimes, a replacement character such as the question mark (?)
  is displayed to represent the unrepresentable character.
</li>
<li>
  The program uses a different output encoding than is expected
  by the terminal. This can result in totally garbled output.
  However, many character encodings have US-ASCII as a common subset.
  In that case, plain characters and numbers will appear correctly,
  but non-ASCII characters such as umlauts are garbled.
  <br/>
  This can be fixed by adjusting the encoding of when writing the output.
  For strings written to the standard output and error streams,
  Java uses its default encoding.
</li>
<li>
  The string representation in the JVM is wrong, because input was received
  in a different encoding than expected by the JVM.
  <br/>
  This can be fixed by adjusting the encoding when reading the input.
  For strings read from the standard input stream,
  Java uses its default encoding.
  For command-line arguments, the terminal has to provide the correct
  character representation when launching Java.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="jdoc-walk-through"><span>JavaDoc Walk-Through</span></h2>

<p>
Open the <a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">JavaDocs</a>
in a new browser tab or window,
so you can easily switch between them and this description.
Check the list of packages. There are three of them,
<code>pityoulish.cmdline</code>, <code>pityoulish.i18n</code>,
and <code>pityoulish.tutorial</code>.
In the main content frame, click on the first one. Now you see a list of
interfaces and classes in that package. Glimpse at the names. They are
about commands, handling, and arguments. The package description begins
with "Utility classes". This indicates that the package does not contain
the main functionality of the program, but supporting features.
Are you interested in learning how the command-line arguments are interpreted?
If so, write it down on your to-do list for later.
Right now, the support functionality is not your concern.
</p>

<p>
Move on to the next package, <code>pityoulish.i18n</code>.
The funny abbreviation is explained in the JavaDocs. There are even links
to external websites where you can do some background reading.
But again, the package description begins with "Utility classes".
So this is another item for your to-do list and a later time.
What you should gather from the package description is that
output strings are not hard-coded in the Java sources.
Instead, they are looked up from properties files.
Catalog enums define lookup keys and helper methods.
</p>

<p>
Finally, access the JavaDocs for the <code>pityoulish.tutorial</code> package.
There is a class <code>Main</code>, described as the main entry point.
Now you know where to start. There is an enum with four constants,
named like the four commands which <code>tutorial.jar</code> understands.
And there is a handler class with methods named like the four commands.
Could <code>handleLatinCmd</code> be the method which prints the umlauts
for the 'latin' command? Yes, the description says so.
Without even looking at the source code, you've learned where the
important things are happening.
</p>

<div class="back-link">
<a onclick="history.back();">Back to the Tutorial</a>
</div>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="source-walk-through"><span>Source Code Walk-Through</span></h2>

<p>
You know from studying the JavaDocs,
or could look up in <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code>,
that the program execution starts with class
<code>pityoulish.tutorial.Main</code>.
Open the source file for that class in your IDE or editor.
</p>

<p>
The <code>main</code> method initializes an arg(ument)s interpreter,
calls it with the command-line arguments, and is done.
If you hadn't looked at the JavaDocs first, you probably would
follow the program execution now and look into the args interpreter.
However, you already know that it comes from a utility package, and that
the commands are implemented in <code>TutorialCommandHandler</code>.
An instance of that class is given to the args interpreter as a
constructor argument. The other constructor argument is some kind of 'None',
so probably not relevant here. The natural conclusion is that
the args interpreter will call the command handler.
Let's go directly to the latter, without wasting time on the former.
</p>

<p>
Looking at <code>TutorialCommandHandler</code>, you see the enumeration of
supported commands, a method that returns usage instructions, and a method
with a <code>switch</code> statement on the enum. Each case of that statement
calls a handler method for the respective command.
Whatever else the args interpreter might do,
it calls here to execute a command.
That's all you need to know about it to get started.
</p>

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="test-local"><span>Testing <code>local</code></span></h2>

<p>
Execute the command and study the output:
</p>
<div><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar tutorial.jar local</code></div>
<p>
Connect your computer to different networks (wired, WiFi, VPN) and repeat.
</p>


<div class="back-link">
<a onclick="history.back();">Back to the Tutorial</a>
</div>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="test-islocal"><span>Testing <code>islocal</code></span></h2>

<p>
Execute the command with different hostname arguments:
</p>
<div><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar tutorial.jar islocal <i>hostname</i></code></div>
<p>
Some arguments to try:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Hostnames and IP addresses printed by the <code>islocal</code> command.
  These should be recognized as local addresses.
</li>
<li>
  Hostnames of internet sites, such as 'example.com'.
  These should be recognized as non-local addresses.
</li>
<li>
  Hostnames and IP addresses of other computers in the local network.
  These should be recognized as non-local addresses.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If these arguments are not recognized as expected, your code is still buggy.
</p>

<p>
When the command is working as expected, play around some more. Can you
find local hostnames that are not printed by the <code>local</code> command?
For example, try the name of your computer without a domain, or with
domain '.local'. What about other IP addresses, like '127.0.0.8'?
Have you tried '::1'?

<h2 id="test-lookup"><span>Testing <code>lookup</code></span></h2>

<p>
Execute the command with different hostname arguments:
</p>
<div><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar tutorial.jar lookup <i>hostname</i></code></div>
<p>
Here are some arguments to try, with expected output.
Some of them require an internet connection for the lookup.
</p>
<ul>
<li>localhost &nbsp;-&nbsp;
  a subset of the output from the <code>local</code> command</li>
<li>nowhere.invalid &nbsp;-&nbsp; no address at all</li>
<li>numeric IPv4 and IPv6 addresses &nbsp;-&nbsp; the argument address
<!-- lookups performed on 2018-09-20: -->
<li>apache.org &nbsp;-&nbsp; two different IPv4 addresses</li>
<li>gnu.org &nbsp;-&nbsp; both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address</li>
</ul>

<p>
Perform some more lookups of your own.

<h2 id="help-islocal"><span>Spoiler: Fixing <code>islocal</code></span></h2>

<p>
The method is small enough to understand it entirely, so strive for that.
At the place of the omission, you will find these lines:
</p>
<div class="code">
  // if the address is local, we can bind a socket to it
  Missing.here("bind a socket to a hostname");
  Missing.pretend(IOException.class);
</div>
<p>
<code>Missing.here</code> triggers the exception that takes you there.
<br/>
<code>Missing.pretend</code> tells the compiler that
an <code>IOException</code> could be raised.
That's because the missing code might do that.
<br/>
You have to remove both lines with <code>Missing</code>
and insert your own code instead.
</p>

<p><i>
Follow the steps below.
Pause after each step.
Make sure you've understood it.
<br/>
If you think you know what to do,
proceed without further guidance instead of following the next step.
</i></p>

<ol class="spoiler-steps">
<li>
The exception message and the comment say "bind a socket".
<br/>
Do you understand what that means?
If not, start an internet search and find out.
</li>

<li>
The method is meant to tell whether a hostname is local or not.
What does that have to do with binding a socket?
<br/>
Look at the source code.
When will it return "local", when "not local"?
<!--
  Returns 0 (local) if binding succeeds,
  or -1 (not local) if binding throws an IOException.
-->
</li>

<li>
What is the Java API for working with sockets?
<br/>
Check the imports. Access the relevant JavaDocs.
<!-- package java.net, specifically class java.net.Socket -->
</li>

<li>
What method do you have to call for binding a socket?
<!-- java.net.Socket.bind(SocketAddress) -->
<br/>
Do you have the required arguments for calling it?
<!-- Yes, InetSocketAddress isa -->
<i>
  (see also <a href="java-refresher.html#available-data">Available Data</a>)
</i>
<br/>
Do you have an object on which to call the method?
If not, how can you create one?
<!-- Socket sock = new Socket() -->
<br/>
Is there a convenience constructor for combining both operations?
<!-- No. -->
</li>

<li>
Insert code as required for the following:
<ol type="a">
  <li>Create a socket to bind, if required.</li>
  <!-- Required. Create an unconnected Socket. -->
  <li>Convert the hostname to the expected format, if required.</li>
  <!-- Not required, the conversion is already implemented. -->
  <li>Bind the socket to the hostname, if required.</li>
  <!-- Required, there is no convenience constructor that binds. -->
  <li>Clean up afterwards, if required.</li>
  <!-- Not required, because no connection is opened.
       The Socket will be garbage-collected. -->
</ol>
<i>Hint:</i> You will need two of those.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Don't mix up <i>binding</i> a socket with <i>connecting</i> a socket.
Both require a hostname or IP address,
but they are completely different operations.

The method is almost empty.
At the place of the omission, you will find these lines:
</p>
<div class="code">
  Missing.here("look up the InetAddress(es) of a hostname");
  // Use formatInetAddress below to print all the addresses.
  // Also handle the case when the hostname has no address at all.
</div>

<p>
<code>Missing.here</code> triggers the exception that takes you there.
<br/>
You have to remove that line
and insert your own code instead.

<p><i>
Follow the steps below.

<ol class="spoiler-steps">
<li>
The exception message says "look up ... a hostname",
JavaDocs for the method say "DNS lookup".
<br/>
Do you understand what that means?
If not, start an internet search and find out.
</li>

<li>
A comment mentions the helper method <code>formatInetAddress</code>.
<br/>
Look at the JavaDoc comment and method signature of that helper, NOTHING MORE!
<br/>
What does it do?
You don't need to read or understand the code of the helper to use it.
</li>

<li>
The helper expects a single address.
The comment about using the helper says "all the addresses".
<br/>
You will have to implement a loop.
</li>

<li>
The helper expects an <code>InetAddress</code>.
<br/>
Check the imports. Access the relevant JavaDocs.
<!-- java.net.InetAddress -->
</li>

<li>
How do you create <code>InetAddress</code> objects?
<br/>
Are there constructors?
Methods for creating or obtaining instances?
<br/>
If not in the class itself, somewhere else in the package?
</li>

<li>
The missing code is expected to perform a DNS lookup for the argument hostname.
<br/>
Have you found a method that performs DNS lookups?
Do you need an object on which to call the method?
<br/>
Do you need to convert the hostname argument?
Do you need to convert the lookup results?
<!-- InetAddress.getAllByName(String host)
  The method static, no object needed for calling it.
  Neither argument nor results need to be converted.
-->
</li>

<li>
Write code to perform the DNS lookup, to loop over the results,
and to call the helper method for each item.
<!-- The code will not compile at this stage unless you implement
     a try-catch block or declare an exception to be thrown by the method.
-->
</li>

<li>
The second comment line mentions hostnames without an address.
<br/>
What does the lookup return in that case?
<code>null</code>, an empty list or array, something else?
<!-- it does not return anything, but throws an exception instead -->
<br/>
Change your code to handle this case.
The method should reach its <code>return</code> statement,
not throw an exception.
<!-- catch java.net.UnknownHostException -->
<br/>
Tell the user explicitly when there is no address for the hostname.
<!-- Print the exception, or a corresponding message.
     Printing the exception does not require a new entry in the Catalog.
     A hard-coded message would be inconsistent with the rest of the code.
