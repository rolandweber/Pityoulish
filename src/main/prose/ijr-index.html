  <span>Instructor's Notes: Message Board with Java RMI</span>
</h1>
<p class="abstract">
During this exercise, students will encounter minor but annoying
technical problems, and wonder about the total lack of security.
Still, it's convenient.
</p>

<div class="larger">
<p>
You're going to run a server for the
<a href="message-board.html">Message Board</a> and
<a href="direct-messages.html">Direct Messages</a>.
Students have to fix Java programs that connect to the server.
The functionality of the first program is identical to the
whole exercise with sockets.
The second program lets them export their own objects for remote invocations.
Missing code requires the students
to work with the RMI registry, handle error situations, and export objects.
The server generates console output
to provide immediate feedback about incoming calls.
</p>
<p>
These Instructor's Notes are organized chronologically:

<li><a href="#prepare">Prepare</a>:
  Get hardware, install software,...</li>
<li><a href="#rehearse">Rehearse</a>:
  Hook up the hardware, work through the exercise yourself.</li>
<li><a href="#execute">Execute</a>:
  Let students work through the exercise, enjoy the show.</li>
<li><a href="#review">Review</a>:
  Lessons learned by the students, by yourself,
  for the next time, for others.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Refer to section <a href="classroom-setup.html#procure">What You Need</a>
in the <a href="classroom-setup.html">Classroom Setup</a>
for generic hardware and software requirements.

The expected <b>server runtime</b> is a Java Development Kit (JDK).
A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) might suffice,
but it's better to be prepared for compiling something.
<a href="mbserver-jrmi.jar"
       ><code>mbserver-jrmi.jar</code></a>
contains the server for both Java RMI programs,
see the box for usage instructions.

Recommended information to put on the local web server includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Classroom Exercise</li>
<li>Tutorial</li>
<li>Previous classroom exercise with sockets</li>
<li>Java API Docs</li>
</ul>

</div></div>

<p>
Perform the <a href="classroom-setup.html#rehearse">Tech Rehearsal</a>
as described in the <a href="classroom-setup.html">Classroom Setup</a>.
This will sort out power, display, network, and software configuration.
You don't want to discover in front of the students that your new computer
has a display adapter which doesn't connect to the projector,
that a cable is too short, or that an operating system update
has moved some configuration dialogs to arcane locations.
</p>

<p>
See above for the server program you need to run.
Parameters to consider:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Port number.
Pick one that isn't blocked by a firewall.
Does 8288 work?
</li>
<li>Board Capacity.
A low capacity, for example 8 instead of 800,
increases the probability of losing messages.
In a production system, that would be undesired.
During the exercise, it exposes a feature of the protocol.
</li>
<li>Server locale.
<i>As of 2016, the server is not yet localized to languages
  other than English.</i>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="side-note"><div class="content">
<span>Content</span>
</div></div>

<p>
Perform a <b>Content Rehearsal</b> by working through the exercise yourself,
on a dedicated client machine. That point is important. Some problems simply
won't arise as long as you are running client and server on the same machine.
If possible, use the actual network of your classroom setup, too.
</p>

<p>
If you're encountering problems during the Content Rehearsal,
maybe you should work through the Tutorial and previous exercise as well?
You need to be prepared even better than the students, because they will be
<span title="If they don't, your position as an instructor is doubtful."
      >looking to you for help</span>.
</p>

<h2 id="execute">
  <span>Execute</span>
  <a href="#execute" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>
Setup the classroom exercise as in the Tech Rehearsal,
and follow your prepared schedule.
Form groups of two to three students working together.
Keep an eye on the server output,
so that the student messages don't get too silly.
You might want to put up a few messages of your own,
open an outlet for direct messages, and send direct messages to everyone,
using the programs that you fixed during the Content Rehearsal.
Or if you skipped the Content Rehearsal after all,
build working programs from the sources on GitHub.

  <span>Hints</span>
  <a href="#hints" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<dl>
<dt>NullPointerException when looking up the Ticket Issuer</dt>
<dd>
...although <code>ensureRegistry()</code> has been fixed in the previous step.
<p>
You must call <code>ensureRegistry()</code> from the lookup method.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Publishing an outlet fails, because it is not reachable</dt>
<dd>
The server tries to call <code>ping</code> on the outlet before publishing it.
If the stub sent to the server does not point to the client, this fails.
By default, the stub may point to localhost, or an IP address from
a different network than the one shared with the server.
There's a property to specify the hostname or IP address of the client.
The outlet program prints a message about that property and how to set it.
A hostname will only work if the server can resolve it via DNS.
</dd>

<dt>Publishing an outlet hangs, no error</dt>
<dd>
This was observed on client machines with a Desktop Firewall.
The server tries to call <code>ping</code>, but the firewall
prevents the connection from the server back to the client machine.
If possible, disable the firewall.
Otherwise, try different ports (see below) when exporting the outlet,
hoping to find one that is left open.
If that doesn't work either, skip publishing an outlet and move on.

<p>
Ports:
21 (FTP), 22 (ssh), 80 (HTTP), 3389 (Windows Remote Desktop),...
</p>

<!-- That's one problem you cannot root out during the Tech Rehearsal. -->
</dd>

<dt>How to List Messages with different markers</dt>
<dd>
<p>
You get a marker in response to a List Messages operation.
The marker indicates where in the message stream the returned messages end.
List messages with different limits to fetch less than the available messages.
</p>
<!-- <br>-->
<p>
Alternatively, put more messages on the board and list messages again.
The markers from previous responses remain valid.

Did they understand what the problems were, or just hack&amp;slay them?
</dd>

<dt>Skill</dt>
<dd>
What unplanned problems did the students encounter, and why?
Bad preparation? Skill gap?
Something important missing from the Tutorial,
in the Exercise description, or
in the topics you taught before/during the exercise?
</dd>

<dt>Objective</dt>

Did the exercise serve your intended purpose,
did it transport what you wanted to teach?
If not, is it a shortcoming of the exercise or a mismatch of objectives?
</dd>
