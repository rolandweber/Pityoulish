  <span>Exercise: Message Board Client with Java RMI</span>
</h1>
<p class="abstract">
During this exercise, you will enjoy the convenience
of remote method invocations.
</p>

<div class="larger">
<p>
Your task is to <a href="test-fix-repeat.html">Test and Fix</a>
a Java program, a
<a href="message-board.html"
   title="high-level description of Message Board functionality"
   >Message Board</a> client
using Java Remote Method Invocation.
This allows for a direct comparison with the Message Board client
using sockets from a previous exercise.
</p>

<p>
A recipe for solving this task has been conveyed beforehand in a Tutorial.
It was applied in a previous exercise with sockets in Java.
If you missed both, you're probably screwed now.
Unless you have experience with programming and debugging.

</h2>
<!--h2 id="prepare"><span>Prepare</span></h2-->

<p>
You already set up a Java development environment in the Tutorial.
Editor, Java compiler and tools, maybe an IDE, are readily available.
Good.
</p>

<p>
You already know how to access the instructions for this exercise,
because you're reading them. Good.
Other useful things you could open in separate browser tabs are
the Java Platform API specification (aka standard JavaDocs)
and the <a href="test-fix-repeat.html">Test and Fix</a> reminder.
Where to find the standard JavaDocs depends on the network setup.
</p>

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="connectivity">
  <span>Network</span>
  <a href="#connectivity" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>
Connect your computer to the network with the server, if you have not
done so already. The instructor provides all necessary information,
along with the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address and port number of the RMI Registry on the server.
  A hostname may replace the IP address.</li>
<li>URL to the Java Platform API JavaDocs,
  if the network is isolated from the Internet.</li>
<li>URL to this exercise, optionally.</li>
</ul>

<dd>The program to test and fix. Usage instructions:

  Sources are in the jar,
  <a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">docs</a> here.
</dd>
</dl>
</div><!-- box-right -->

<p>
Download the client program, <a href="mbclient-jrmi-faulty.jar"
                        ><code>mbclient-jrmi-faulty.jar</code></a>,
and give it a decent filename.
</p>

<p>
Run the client without arguments to obtain the usage instructions.
Read and understand those.
Each command corresponds with an operation of the
<a href="message-board.html"
   title="high-level description of Message Board functionality"
   >Message Board</a>.
This client supports exactly the same commands as the client with sockets.

<p>
You can re-use the test sequence from the previous exercise
about the Message Board Client with sockets.
For example:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
List messages from the board, without marker.
</li>
<li>
Obtain a ticket.
</li>
<li>
Put some messages on the board.
</li>
<li>
List messages again, with and without marker.
Use different markers.
</li>
<li>
Return a ticket.
Use it again afterwards, to verify that it is no longer valid.
</li>
<li>
Replace a ticket, before and after exhausting all operations.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are three problems to find and fix.
Before hacking the code, get an

</h3>

<p>
If you completed the test sequence with time to spare,
write a more convenient client for posting messages.
You're welcome to re-use code from the exercise, of course.
Your new client should execute these steps in one go:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Obtain a token.
</li>
<li>
Post a message.
</li>
<li>
Return the token.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The <a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">JavaDocs</a>
for this exercise are split into three groups.
The Remote API and Message Board Client are the topic of this exercise,
they are briefly described here.
The last group comprises support packages which are already known from
the Tutorial.
</p>

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="code-RemoteAPI">
  <span>Remote API</span>
  <a href="#code-RemoteAPI" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>
The Remote API in <code>pityoulish.jrmi.api</code> defines the glue
which keeps clients and server<!--, outlets and senders--> together.
There are two interfaces for remotely callable objects,
the names start with <code>Remote*</code>.
These interfaces extend <code>java.rmi.Remote</code>.
Objects implementing these interfaces will reside on the server
and can be looked up in the RMI registry.
The lookup names are defined by an enum, <code>RegistryNames</code>.
</p>

<p>
The remaining two interfaces in the Remote API describe
data that is passed in remote calls.
They extend <code>java.io.Serializable</code>, and
there are implementation classes in the Remote API.
This ensures that all participants can deserialize the objects.
Finally, the <code>APIException</code> is for reporting errors.
It is intentionally not derived from <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code>,
to clearly distinguish Java RMI problems from application problems.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="code-MessageBoard">
  <span>Message Board Client</span>
  <a href="#code-MessageBoard" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>
Package <code>pityoulish.jrmi.client</code>
contains the client for the Message Board.
It relies on the interfaces and classes of the Remote API.
Package <code>pityoulish.mbclient</code> is familiar from a previous exercise.
Commands are delegated to a <code>MsgBoardClientHandler</code>,
backend arguments recorded by a <code>HostPortBackendHandler</code>.
The <code>.client</code> package extends the backend handler with
some lookup methods.
A <code>DataFormatter</code> is responsible for printing data
obtained from the server.
Each of the interfaces has a single implementation class.
</p>

</h2>

<p>
Did you get through the full test sequence in time?
If not, where or how did you lose time?
</p>

<p>
How do you like coding on this level?
Compare to the exercise with sockets.
</p>

<p>
Which security gaps did you spot during the exercise?
Should those be addressed by the application, or by Java RMI?
</p>

<!--
Is there a sensible programming task in this context?
A long-running client, like for the sockets exercise, seems too dull.

This exercise is from <i>Pityoulish</i>,
an Open Source project hosted on GitHub.
<!-- Intentionally not linked here...
     https://github.com/rolandweber/pityoulish/
     Don't want to point students there during the exercise :-)

If you want to help, you can submit Pull Requests
with improvements to the instructions or the code.
Among the Issues is a selection of smaller and bigger implementation tasks,
tagged with "help wanted". Most of them are about coding, but you can also
help with translations, by proof-reading, inventing new exercises, and more.
