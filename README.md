# Pityoulish
A collection of programming exercises to support a course on _Distributed Systems_.

## Background
I've been teaching a course on _Distributed Systems_ once a year, for over a decade now. It's mostly lectures and theory, so I tried to add some practice in the form of two programming exercises. Both implement basically the same client-server functionality, the first one with socket connections and a binary protocol, the other with Java RMI. I provided the server component, students could write their own client, and then I'd hook up my netbook with the server to a projector and let the students try out their clients.

The programming exercises are completely optional and do not affect the grades in any way. Most of the students would try the first exercise, but not necessarily succeed. Of those that succeeded, some spent way too much time. So the number of students that would attempt the second programming exercise was... low. Despite my attempts to provide utility classes and better instructions, it remained low.

In 2015, I tried a different approach. Instead of asking the students to program a client, I provided one - from which I had removed a few, carefully selected code lines. The students just had to test all available commands of the client and fix the holes. Exceptions pointed them directly to the missing code sections.
The first programming exercise was done at home and tried out in the classroom. I received feedback that the task was too simple, but might work as an in-class exercise. So I held the second programming exercise in class.

As it turned out, the in-class programming exercise was too complex for most of the students. But I learned a lot about the problems they were facing. Too much information to digest in the exercise description. A lack of proficiency in Java programming. Too much code with an unknown structure to wade through.
I believe that those problems can be addressed by providing an improved collection of programming exercises. Better instructions. Better descriptions of the available code. Gradual skill build-up, with guided preparation at home and supervised problem-solving in class. And some optional programming tasks for those who are interested.

This project, Pityoulish, is the future home of my programming exercises. I already have a bunch of code, but I don't want to just dump that here. Instead, I'm going to build a new set of programming exercises, and refactor parts of the old ones as I go along. I'm not in a hurry though. The next class of students will face these exercises in October 2016. You should expect slow progress until summer and last-minute panic in September.
